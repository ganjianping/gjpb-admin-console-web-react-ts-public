# Code Cleanup Report - App Settings Module

## Date: October 4, 2025

This document summarizes the unused code removal from the app-settings module.

---

## 🗑️ Removed Unused Code

### 1. **Deleted `hooks/useNotification.ts`** ✅
**Reason**: File was only re-exporting from shared-lib but never used
- The notification functionality is handled inline in `AppSettingsPage.tsx`
- No imports found for this hook anywhere in the module

### 2. **Removed `FILTER_OPTIONS` Constant** ✅
**Location**: `constants/index.ts`
**Reason**: Defined but never imported or used
- Was intended for filter dropdowns but not implemented yet
- Can be re-added when needed

### 3. **Removed `isValidationError` Function** ✅
**Location**: `utils/error-handler.ts`
**Reason**: Exported but never called
- Utility function that's not currently needed
- `extractValidationErrors` alone is sufficient

### 4. **Removed Unused `appSetting` Prop** ✅
**Location**: `components/AppSettingDialog.tsx`
**Reason**: Prop was defined but never used in the component
- Component only uses `formData` which is passed separately
- Removed both the prop definition and `Omit` type usage

### 5. **Removed Unused `AppSetting` Import** ✅
**Location**: `components/AppSettingDialog.tsx`
**Reason**: After removing the unused prop, the type import was no longer needed

### 6. **Removed Unnecessary `React` Import** ✅
**Location**: `components/AppSettingPageHeader.tsx`
**Reason**: Modern React doesn't require React import for JSX
- Using new JSX transform

## 🔧 Fixed Issues

### 1. **Fixed Incorrect Import in `useAppSettingSearch.ts`** ✅
**Before**:
```typescript
import type { AppSetting } from '../services/appSettingService';
```

**After**:
```typescript
import type { AppSetting } from '../types/app-setting.types';
```

**Reason**: Should import types from the centralized types file, not from services

### 2. **Consolidated Duplicate Imports** ✅
**Location**: `hooks/useAppSettingSearch.ts`
**Before**:
```typescript
import type { AppSetting } from '../types/app-setting.types';
import type { AppSettingSearchFormData } from '../types/app-setting.types';
```

**After**:
```typescript
import type { AppSetting, AppSettingSearchFormData } from '../types/app-setting.types';
```
